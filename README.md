# Landing the Future: Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landings

The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches at a significantly lower cost of approximately $62 million compared to other providers, whose prices typically start at $165 million. One of the reasons for this cost advantage is that SpaceX is able to land and reuse the first stage of the rocket. To assess whether an alternate company should bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch, we can make predictions on the likelihood of the first stage landing successfully.

The goal of this project is to develop a prediction model that can accurately determine if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. By predicting the outcome of the first stage landing, we can estimate the overall cost of the rocket launch, which can be used to evaluate and compare bids from alternate companies against SpaceX.
